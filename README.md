# Loc
Save, organize, and share places with friends

## How it works? 
All places inside a list should be geographically close together. So the list should describe a cuisine, specific kind of vibe, or places to show a visiting friend. Depending on when you're geographically located, the relevant lists will show. Of course you can see lists you saved in other places, but the intentional is for the app to perform most relevantly to you without touching anything.
