# MESA
Save, organize, and share places with friends. A friend's recomendation is more valuable than any stranger.
## Dream Big
Dream big, really big. Even if you only achieve half, you will acheive more than your competition. Don't die with a whimper, always push bigger and higher. Don't be afriad of a failing, just try.
## Mesa's Big Dream
We want to make the future of digital business profiles. Google maps is antiquated. Businesses shouldn't have to run, maintain, or pay for a website. Any business owner should be able to manage their online prescence from their iPhone and do it more effectively than spending even thousands of dollars on websites or marketing agencies. We start this dream by helping users create a community of places with their friends. We believe a friend's recomendation is much more valuable than any random review on the internet.
